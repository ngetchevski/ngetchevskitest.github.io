The objective of this assignment was to first choose a typeface, and then pick a specific letter to focus on. Using this letter, I had to define its anatomy, such as stem, x-height, axis, etc. I chose a blackletter typeface named 'Goudy Text,' due to its ornate nature and varying line weight. I based my design on the poster based on the shapes and movement of Goudy Text's capital letter 'T.'; descPosition: right;">

I chose the headphones I was using at the time and recreated them as vector art in Illustrator. I stuck with the orange and black and white theme, since those were the prominent colors on the headset. ; descPosition: right;">

I chose to name my company 'Humblebee,' since I wanted it to be centered around bee products, such as honey, candles made from beeswax, and candy. These products were designed to be shipped to your house as a monthly subscription box. The only survivng portion of my project is the logo, since the rest unfortunately resides on a corrupted drive. I focused my design around the hexagonal patterns of a honeycomb, which is prominent throughout the design. I use a bubbly sans-serif font to juxtapose the rigid edges of the logo itself. ; descPosition: right;">

The object was to gather several images of various font styles and create a cohesive image within a 10 inch by 10 inch plate sectioned into a 5 by 5 grid of squares. I then had to seemlessly try to blend these squares together, so that the grid itself would be as least noticeable as possible. I chose to stick with black and white letters and focused primarily on script and serif typefaces. ; descPosition: right;">

The objective was to design a positive and negative poster of yourself using Information that we had to record a week prior. I kept the theme of both posters similar, especially the color schemes and some of the graphs. For the positive poster I chose to focus on my health, since I try to take care of my health through adequate sleep, excercise, and nutrition. I chose my bar graph to resemble glasses of water, since I thought it was more visually interesting and relevant than a standard bar graph. I chose to focus on procrastination for my negative poster, since I am guilty of that. I reused my data on sleep, since I saw it also as a period of unproductivity, and therefore negative. ; descPosition: right;">

I personally do not own 100 tangible things, so I chose the unique route of focusing on relatively 100 organs within my body. I thought this would be both interesting and topical, since medicine runs in my family. I chose to categorize the organs through a L.A.T.C.H. filter by organ system, alphebetically, time you can live without them, color, location in body, and size of the organ. I chose to make it look like a classical anatomical poster with a pale-blue and turquoise background. ; descPosition: right;">

                        <p>Graphic Design, Fine Arts, Game Design; I seldom restrict myself to a single artistic path. Instead, I want my work and life to encompass as many artistic mediums as possible, since I believe that we should all indulge in a little bit of everything so that we don't miss out on unique experiences, while learning what skills to hone. I treat design in the same regard.</p>
